## Example Usage

const client = new Discord.Client();

const Dokdo = require("dokdo-selfbot");

const DokdoHandler = new Dokdo(client, {
  aliases: ["dokdo", "dok"],
  prefix: "!",
  owners: ["123456789"], // Replace with your Discord user ID
});

client.on("messageCreate", async (message) => {
  if (message.content === "ping") {
    return message.channel.send("Pong"); // Handle normal commands first
  }
  DokdoHandler.run(message); // Test with commands like "!dokdo"
});

client.login("your-token-here"); // Replace with your selfbot token
```

## Notes

### Do You Need the Message Contents Intent?

No! Since this tool is designed for Discord selfbots, intents are not required as selfbots already have access to all messages and events. This tool can also interpret message content with custom prefixes, including mentions.

Example:

```js
new Dokdo(client, { prefix: "<@YOUR_USER_ID>" }); // Set your user mention as a prefix

// Example Command Usage: <@YOUR_USER_ID> dokdo
```
